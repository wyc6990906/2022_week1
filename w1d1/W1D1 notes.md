Sublime shortcuts - MacOS
Sublime Tutor: Interactive tutorial for Sublime
Git cheatsheet
Welcome to bootcamp! With this first breakout, we took a look at some of the tools of the trade:

Terminal
Vagrant
Sublime Text
The purpose of the breakout is to introduce to becoming a power user/student!

Lectures
After taking a look at the curriculum, we had a brief discussion about lectures + breakouts.

Lectures are great for:

showing approach
problem solving
structure of projects
high level concepts
entertainment
Lectures are not very good for:

learning syntax
learning exactly how to do something
all-around in-depth knowledge
What should you do during lecture?
DO NOT code along
write down notes about high-level concepts
"I saw Nima do that cool thing...""
You might want to write your notes using Markdown - cheat sheet

Daily folder structure
There are a couple options. What I've seen work well are these:

w1d1
w1d2
w1d3

w1

d1
d2
d3
w2

Tools!
TERMINAL
cd - change directory
mkdir - make directory
ls - list subdirectories
touch - creates a file

AUTOCOMPLETION - use it!

SUBLIME
awesome text editor!
Here are some shortcuts:

CMD + N - new tab (new file)

Cmd + S, SAVE YOUR STUFF

CMD + SHIFT + [ / ] - cycle left/right Ctr + CMD + Space - mac emoji menu Cmd + C, Cmd + V, Cmd + X - copy, paste, cut Cmd + ~ - cycle through multiple Sublime windows Cmd + P - quick open files Cmd + F - find in file Cmd + Shift + F - find in all files

VERSION CONTROL + DEMO
Version control means keeping a labelled history of our project. Git is a program that lets us do that. Github is a website where we can upload our git repos.

Philosophy of GIT
REPOSITORIES (REPOS): A SINGLE FOLDER FOR EVERY PROJECT Commits: labelled milestones

8 GIT COMMANDS THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
git init - initiate a git repo

git status - checks the status of the repo (any new files? any new changes?)

git add - add a (or multiple) file(s) changes to the new commit git add testFile.js or git add . (for all files)

git commit - save that point in time, with a message git commit -m "did some stuff"

git remote - allow me to communicate with another computer (backup my stuff) (git remote add origin <SOME GITHUB REPO>)

git push - push local changes to remote! git push origin master

git pull - pull changes from remote git pull origin master

git log - list out history of commits

WARNING: DO NOT MAKE GIT REPOSITORIES WITHIN OTHER REPOSITORIES.
